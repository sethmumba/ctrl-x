    <h1 class="policy-title">Refund Policy</h1>
    <h5 class="policy-updated">Last Updated: December 3, 2025</h5>

    <p class="policy-intro">
        Empx Automations provides a non-tangible, custom-built digital service (the Automated Shopify Store build). 
        The moment an order is confirmed, our automated systems and specialized resources begin allocation and work, 
        meaning costs are immediately incurred. Therefore, we maintain a strict refund policy, favoring the completion 
        and delivery of our service over cancellation. Refunds are only available under very limited and specific conditions 
        as detailed below.
    </p>

    <div class="policy-section">
        <h2 class="policy-heading">1. Non-Refundable Service & Eligibility Criteria</h2>
        
        <h3 class="policy-heading">1.1 General Non-Refundable Nature</h3>
        <p class="policy-text">
            Due to the immediate commitment of resources and the proprietary, custom nature of the digital product, 
            all sales are generally considered final. </p>
        
        <h3 class="policy-heading">1.2 Strict Refund Eligibility Window</h3>
        <ul class="policy-list">
            <li>A refund request must be made within seven (7) calendar days from the original purchase date.</li>
            <li>The Shopify store must not have been delivered to the client's email or accessible in any way.</li>
            <li>If the store has been delivered, it must be demonstrably unusable due to a major, irreparable technical defect caused solely by Empx Automations (see Section 2).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 class="policy-heading">1.3 Automatic Voidance of Refund Eligibility</h3>
        <p class="policy-text">
            A refund is immediately and permanently voided if any of the following actions occur, as they constitute acceptance and use of the service:
        </p>
        <ul class="policy-list">
            <li>The delivered Shopify store has generated any revenue, including a successful test order or a single dollar ($1) sale.</li>
            <li>The client has connected a custom domain, installed any paid or premium applications, or purchased any theme/asset upgrades.</li>
            <li>The client has changed the store’s financial, billing, or ownership information after delivery.</li>
            <li>The store has progressed beyond its initial free trial phase and is subject to Shopify’s recurring billing.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
        <h2 class="policy-heading">2. Approved Refund Scenarios (Empx Automations Fault)</h2>
        <p class="policy-text">
            We will only consider a refund when the service was not delivered or is fundamentally broken due to our error.
        </p>
        <ul class="policy-list">
            <li><strong>Non-Delivery:</strong> The store was not delivered within the promised timeframe (e.g., 24-72 hours) and the client was **not** provided a valid reason for delay (e.g., waiting for client input) **AND** the request is made before delivery.</li>
            <li><strong>Irreparable Major Setup Error:</strong> The store was delivered but contains a critical, demonstrable technical malfunction (e.g., inability to process payment through standard gateways) that our technical team is **unable to fix** within five (5) business days after the issue is reported.</li>
            <li><strong>Duplicated Charge:</strong> A verified duplicate charge was accidentally processed by our payment gateway (e.g., PayPal) for the same service.</li>
            <li><strong>Pre-Build Cancellation:</strong> An order was placed with wrong information or by mistake, and the client contacts us to cancel **before** our automation systems have commenced the build process (generally within 30 minutes of purchase).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
        <h2 class="policy-heading">3. Non-Refundable Scenarios (Client Responsibility or Usage)</h2>
        <p class="policy-text">
            Refunds will unequivocally NOT be granted for any of the following reasons, which are outside of our control or represent dissatisfaction with subjective aspects of the delivered product:
        </p>
        <ul class="policy-list">
            <li><strong>Change of Mind:</strong> The client changes their business niche, changes their mind about dropshipping, or decides they no longer need the store after delivery.</li>
            <li><strong>Marketing Failure:</strong> Dissatisfaction with the store's performance or inability to generate sales, as success depends entirely on the client’s marketing and operational efforts.</li>
            <li><strong>Client-Caused Errors:</strong> Any issue arising from the client providing incomplete, incorrect, or misleading information during the setup phase.</li>
            <li><strong>Post-Delivery Modification Errors:</strong> Errors or damages to the store configuration caused by the client editing code, installing incompatible apps, or changing core Shopify settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Shopify Suspension:</strong> Store closure or suspension by Shopify due to the client’s actions, content violations, or failure to comply with Shopify's Terms of Service.</li>
            <li><strong>Subjective Dissatisfaction:</strong> Dissatisfaction with the store’s aesthetics, product choices, or theme layout, as these are provided as-is and within the scope of the chosen package.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="policy-section">
        <h2 class="policy-heading">4. Refund Procedure and Dispute Handling</h2>
        
        <h3 class="policy-heading">4.1 Request Process</h3>
        <p class="policy-text">
            To request a refund under the eligible scenarios in Section 2, the client must contact us at support@empxautomations.site within the seven (7) day window, clearly detailing the reason and providing objective evidence (screenshots, delivery timestamp) 
            to support the claim. We reserve the right to access the delivered store to verify the claim.
        </p>

        <h3 class="policy-heading">4.2 Resolution Process</h3>
        <p class="policy-text">
            Before any refund is approved, Empx Automations reserves the sole right to attempt to fix any reported technical errors within five (5) business days. 
            A refund will only be processed if the error is verified and deemed irreparable by our technical team.
        </p>

        <h3 class="policy-heading">4.3 Chargebacks and Disputes</h3>
        <p class="policy-text">
            Filing a dispute or chargeback with your bank or payment processor (e.g., PayPal) without first contacting us to resolve the issue 
            will constitute a breach of this Policy. Any client initiating a non-qualifying chargeback will be permanently banned from using all 
            future Empx Automations services. We reserve the right to dispute all unauthorized chargebacks and recover any associated fees.
